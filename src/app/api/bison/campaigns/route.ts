// Campaigns for one or more clients. All clients share one EmailBison workspace, so campaigns
// are associated by NAME ("Client Name + Sender + Market") using the SHARED matcher in
// @/lib/bison/match-campaign — the same one the 6-hourly sync uses to attribute leads.
//
// This route used to do its own strict SQL matching, which disagreed with the sync: campaigns
// whose leads the sync had attributed to a client did not appear in this list, so an operator
// could not send to them. 13 clients were affected, 47 campaigns invisible, 72,407 leads behind
// them — Jeff Cook Real Estate had 13 campaigns and an empty dropdown. See the module for the
// shapes that were missed (numbered variants, "Copy of ...", leading "The", punctuation).
//
// Params (any one):
//   orchClientIds=id1,id2  — preferred; multi-select. Campaigns come back tagged per client.
//   orchClientId=id        — single orch client (back-compat).
//   clientId=id            — legacy clients.id (single).
// Response: { campaigns: [{ id, bison_campaign_id, bison_id, name, status, is_default,
//                           client_id, client_name }] }
