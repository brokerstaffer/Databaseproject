// Mirrors Instantly into instantly_client_leads: campaign MEMBERSHIP plus replied and bounced
// flags, the same shape bison_client_leads has. 0108 renamed the table and added the flags; the
// SQL functions read it through v_replied_agents / v_bounced_agents / v_agent_campaigns.
//
// This used to be replies-only. Membership was added because 58,240 agents sat in an Instantly
// campaign and no Bison campaign, so they read as "not in campaign" while being actively emailed —
// the same blind spot replies had before 0106.
//
// TWO THINGS IT DOES DELIBERATELY DIFFERENTLY FROM bison-sync:
//
// 1. ONE TRANSACTION, FLAGS ALREADY RESOLVED. Bison replaces campaign by campaign and re-inserts
//    rows with replied/bounced at their default false, then reconciles them after the whole loop —
//    which left a 10-15 minute window where the Replied filter under-reported, measured draining
//    from 2,731 rows to 153 mid-sync. Here all three sweeps finish first, every row is built with
//    its flags already set, and the delete+insert is one transaction. There is no intermediate
//    state to observe at all.
//
// 2. NO REAPER. Bison deletes rows for campaigns that vanished; replacing the whole table in one
//    statement makes that unnecessary — anything absent from the new membership sweep is simply
//    not re-inserted.
//
// Runs in the BACKGROUND like bison-sync: membership alone is ~14 minutes, far past maxDuration.
// The route returns 202 and the real numbers land in audit_logs (action='instantly_reply_sync').
