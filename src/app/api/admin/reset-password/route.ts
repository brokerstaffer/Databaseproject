  // alike to /accept-invite -- an "accept your invitation" screen shown to an existing user who
  // asked to reset a password. The callback sends recovery to /set-password, which is the page
  // that actually means it.
  //
  // NOTE: this only works once the redirect is allowlisted in Supabase (Authentication -> URL
  // Configuration). If it is not, Supabase silently falls back to its Site URL and the link goes
