// Railway cron-service entrypoint: runs BOTH provider syncs, in order, then exits.
//
// This replaced `node scripts/cron-bison-sync.mjs` as the bison-cron service's start command when
// Instantly was connected, so one cron service covers both providers on the same 6-hourly schedule
// rather than adding a second service that could drift out of step.
//
// The two scripts are spawned as child processes rather than imported: each one uses top-level
// await and calls process.exit(), so importing the first would end the run before the second
// started.
//
// They are INDEPENDENT on purpose. Bison runs first (it was here first, and its own lead mirror is
// fire-and-forget so the request returns quickly), but Instantly runs whether or not Bison
// succeeded -- an EmailBison API outage must not stop reply data arriving from Instantly. The exit
// code is non-zero if EITHER failed, so Railway still shows the run as failed and the other
// provider's result is not hidden by it.
//
// Env vars needed on the cron service (unchanged): CRON_TOKEN, optionally APP_URL.
